Module 11 Challenge 

Using automated webscraping, collected pertinent data and analyzed to determine the following.

#### Minimum Temperature

As shown in the graph entitled 'Average Minimum Temperature by Month: Coldest to Hottest' 
- The coldest month on Mars is month 3. 
- The hottest month on Mars is Month 8.

#### Atmospheric Pressure

The graph entitled 'Average Pressure by Month: Lowest to Highest' shows:
- The lowest average pressure was observed in Martian Month 6. 
- The highest average pressure was observed in Martian Month 9.

#### Year Length

Looking at the graph entitled 'Minimum Temperature Over Time' we observe approximately three cycles of the temperature dataimplying three Martian years of temperature measurements. There are approximately 1900 Terrestrial days shown in the graph during those three cycles. Therefore we can estimate that a Martian year is approximately 633 terrestrial days long.
